# درايَة (Draya) — Design System Guidelines

This document outlines the core visual, interactive, and structural guidelines of the **درايَة (Draya)** platform. It preserves the primary brand identity while providing clear, flexible boundaries for extending layouts, colors, animations, and illustration choices.

---

## 1. Core Color Palette (Non-Negotiable Brand Values)

The primary color scale defines the core visual identity of **درايَة** as a premium educational assistant. These values must remain consistent across all workspaces.

### 🟢 Primary Teal Scale (Core Brand)
- **Primary Accent (`--draya-primary-700`)**: `#1B6D63` — Used for main interactive elements, primary buttons, and headings.
- **Dark Accent (`--draya-primary-900`)**: `#0F4F49` — Used for footers, visual decoration backdrops, and high-emphasis panels.
- **Medium Dark (`--draya-primary-800`)**: `#145A53` — Used for cards hover states and subtle borders.
- **Soft Backgrounds**:
  - `primary50` (`#F5FCFB`)
  - `primary100` (`#DDF5F1`)
  - `primary200` (`#B7E8E1`)

### 🔮 AI Accent Scale (AI-Powered features)
- **AI Highlight (`--draya-ai-700`)**: `#7C3AED` — Used for AI Exam Builder badges, AI reports, and smart analytics metrics.
- **AI Soft (`--draya-ai-50`)**: `#F7F3FF` — Used for background tints behind generated AI blocks.

## 2. Flexible Accent System (Allowing Extension)

While the primary brand remains teal and violet (AI), you are encouraged to use a flexible supporting color system when adding new modules, academic subjects, or badges.

### Supporting Academic Subject Colors
Feel free to use contrasting semantic colors to identify different subjects or statuses:
- **Math/Physics**: Blue (`#3B82F6`) or Amber (`#F59E0B`)
- **Chemistry/Biology**: Emerald (`#22C55E`) or Cyan (`#06B6D4`)
- **Humanities**: Pink/Rose (`#EC4899`)
- **Rules for New Colors**:
  1. Always pair a strong foreground accent color with its ultra-light counterpart (opacity `8%` to `12%`) as a card or badge background to guarantee legibility.
  2. Maintain a contrast ratio of at least `4.5:1` for text against any custom background.

## 3. Imagery, Blob Shapes, and Illustrations

To make the platform feel organic, modern, and alive, we blend real human photography with abstract layouts, SVG illustrations, and organic blob shapes.

### 🎨 Guidelines for Graphics:
- **Real Photography**: High-quality imagery of students and classrooms (sourced from `@/shared/constants/photos.ts`) should be framed with slight rotations (`rotate-1` or `-rotate-1`), rounded corners (`16px`), and soft borders to feel like floating cards.
- **Vector Illustrations**: You can replace or augment real images with clean vector educational illustrations (flat or isometric) using the brand's teal and soft accents.
- **Organic Blobs (`BlobBg` / SVGs)**:
  - Use overlapping gradient blobs (`linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(27,109,99,0.12) 0%, rgba(124,58,237,0.06) 100%)`) to break up strict grid layouts.
  - Keep blob background shapes behind text layers to add layers of depth without interfering with reading flow.
- **Abstract Patterns (`DecorativeScatter`)**: Use light dot-matrix grids or grid lines to populate empty header spaces.

## 4. Layout & Mobile Responsiveness

The platform is designed **RTL-first (Right-to-Left)**.

### Stacking Guidelines (Mobile & Desktop)
- **Multi-column Grids**: Side-by-side elements (such as split hero pages, stats strips, and multi-card columns) must stack vertically as columns on mobile screens (`flex-col md:flex-row`).
- **Burger Menu Drawer**: The student and teacher headers collapse completely on mobile into a clean right-side navigation drawer (`right: 0`), preventing any horizontal link overflows.
- **Minimum Touch Targets**: Make sure all buttons, toggles, and clickable drawer links meet the `44px x 44px` minimum touch target size standard for mobile devices.

---

## 5. Animations & Micro-interactions

Motion should make the platform feel responsive and dynamic, never slow.

### ✨ Preserving Motion:
- **Active Click Scales**: All interactive buttons should scale down slightly on click (`active:scale-[0.98]`) to feel tactile.
- **Hover Transitions**: Apply smooth timing properties (`transition: all 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`) for card hovers, link highlights, and button expansions.
- **Slide-In Drawers**: Sidebar navigation drawers must animate off-screen cleanly using coordinate transitions (`transition: right 0.3s ease-in-out`) rather than raw display toggles.
- **Entrance Animations**: Use soft fade-in/slide-up keyframes (`animate-fade-in` / `translate-y-4` to `translate-y-0`) for modal entries, warning cards, and success checkmarks.

---

## 6. Advanced Visual Design Patterns (Added Sprint 11)

These patterns must be enforced across all marketing and pricing elements of the platform:

### 🌟 Premium Recommended Plan Badge (Sparkles Badge)
- **Gradient**: `linear-gradient(135deg, #F59E0B 0%, #EF4444 100%)` (Warm Amber to Ruby Red).
- **Icons**: A rotating gold `Sparkles` icon next to the text.
- **Shadow**: `0 10px 20px -5px rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.4)` (glowing red/orange shadow).
- **Badge Text**: Strictly **"موصى به 🔥"** (Recommended).

### 🧾 Flat Borderless FAQ Accordion Layout
- **Container**: Zero card wrapper boxes; rows are borderless transparent containers separated by a thin horizontal divider: `border-bottom: 1px solid ${t.border}`.
- **Chevron Toggle Circular Button**:
  - **Collapsed**: Soft teal circular background (`#F0FAF7`) with primary green `ChevronDown`.
  - **Expanded**: Solid primary green circular background (`t.primary`) with white `ChevronDown` rotated 180 degrees.
  - **Interaction**: Row button spans full width with `justify-content: space-between` and event propagation stopped cleanly.

### 🫧 Bleeding Background Blobs (Anti-Clipping Pattern)
- **Page Container rule**: Never use `overflow-hidden` on individual page container divs (e.g. dashboard, grades list, exams page). Doing so cuts the blurred background blobs sharply, creating harsh vertical/horizontal edges.
- **Layout Wrapper rule**: Enforce `overflow-x: hidden` exclusively at the outermost root layout shells (`StudentLayout` and `TeacherLayout`). This prevents horizontal scrollbars while letting absolute blurred elements bleed past content boundaries and fade out smoothly towards the viewport edges.
